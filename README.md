- JSX is a  javascript syntax which is easier to create react element.

- JSX is not a part of react , we can write react without JSX also. But it makes life of a developer easy so that's why we use JSX.
 
 - JSX is not HTML inside javascript , JSX is a HTML or XML like syntax.
 - JSX is not a pure js , browser and js engine cannot understand or read this code .

 - jsx code is first transpiled before it goes to Js engine and then js engine receives the code that browser understand 

 - Parcel help in the process of transpilation and parcel done this with help of node package known as Babel.

- Babel helps in the transpilation of JSX code to react code . 
- transpile means that the code is converted to a code that browser can understand.

- JSX first transpile code to React.createElement => React Element js object => HTML element(render).
